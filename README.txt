The application is a Python program. You can run it by opening it via IDLE and running it there, or you can enter "python Q1.py" in powershell.

You will need to enter the name of the created database (the default names are in brackets), the user name, and your user password for postgres.

A menu will be displayed with every single required function - just enter the corresponding number and hit return to select that function.
The program will then prompt you for additional inputs if necessary.

There are some error checking measures put in place, but they don't cover everything - entering incorrect database parameters (bad password) will result in the program crashing.
